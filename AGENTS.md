## CLI Commands

All commands run via `uv run zed-i18n <command>`. Target Zed version is in `config/project.toml`.
Use the global `--root <path>` flag only when running from outside the repository root.
If `uv` cannot launch on Windows, fall back to `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m tools.zed_i18n.cli <command>`.

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `fetch-zed` | Clone the Zed release configured in `config/project.toml` to `.cache/zed/<version>` and `.cache/zed/<version>-clean-extract` |
| `extract --zed-root <path>` | Parse Rust sources and write `catalog/en-US.json` + `manifest/ui-strings.json` |
| `generate-version-diff [--base-ref <ref>]` | Compare the Git baseline with the current extract and write version-change references under `reports/version-diff/` |
| `audit-candidates --zed-root <path>` | Audit string candidates against extraction rules; report to `reports/` |
| `prepare-translation --language <lang>` | Generate translation batch prompts under `reports/translation/<lang>/` |
| `extract-context-groups --language <lang>` | Extract grouped setting title/description, connected multi-line, and prompt-component review reports to `reports/context-groups/<lang>/` |
| `merge-translation --language <lang>` | Merge agent result JSONs into `translations/<lang>.json` |
| `validate --language <lang>` | Validate translations against manifest; on success cleans the workspace unless `--no-cleanup` is passed |
| `apply --language <lang>` | Patch translated strings into the Zed checkout |
| `generate-runtime-bundles` | Generate embedded runtime locale bundles into `<zed-root>/assets/locales` from the catalog, manifest, and every enabled translation (universal release build) |
| `apply-universal` | Rewrite accepted strings in the build checkout into runtime `localization` lookups for the single universal build; requires `generate-runtime-bundles` first and a checkout whose byte spans still match the manifest |

Key flags for `prepare-translation`: `--zed-root`, `--batch-size` (default 40), `--context-lines` (default 12), `--missing-only` (explicit default), `--all` (include already-translated strings), `--output-dir`, `--prompt`, `--vscode-loc-root`, `--vscode-source-root`, `--vscode-reference-count` (default 3).
Key flags for `extract-context-groups`: `--language`, `--zed-root`, `--group-type` (`all`, `settings`, `connected`, `prompt`, `prompt-components`; default `all`), `--output-dir`.
Key flags for `validate`: `--no-cleanup` (preserve `reports/translation/<lang>` after successful validation).

Key flags for `merge-translation`: `--results-dir` (agent JSON results), `--output` (write to a custom path instead of `translations/<lang>.json`).


## Pipeline Sequence

```
fetch-zed
  → extract  (on clean checkout)
  → generate-version-diff  (version bumps only)
  → audit-candidates  (on clean checkout)
  → [candidate/status review]
  → prepare-translation
  → [AI agents write batch results]
  → merge-translation
  → validate
  → apply  (on build checkout, not the clean one)
```

Release builds are universal: CI replaces the last step with
`generate-runtime-bundles` followed by `apply-universal` against the build
checkout (`ci_release build-shard --mode universal`, one build per
platform/arch, locale-less asset names, locale alias entries in the release
manifest for legacy clients). The per-language `apply` path remains for local
inspection and as the `--mode per-language` CI rollback path; delete it once
universal releases have proven stable for a cycle or two.

## Zed Checkouts

- `.cache/zed/<version>-clean-extract` — for `extract`, `audit-candidates`, `prepare-translation` source context. Never apply translations to this checkout.
- `.cache/zed/<version>` — for `apply` and local builds.
- Do not delete `.cache/zed` or run `cargo clean` unless the user explicitly asks.
- When bumping the Zed version in `config/project.toml`, manually review the `distribution.py` patch targets and the `config/distribution.toml` overlay against the fetched Zed checkout before release work.
- When bumping the Zed version, also compare `docker/linux-builder/environment.toml` and `docker/linux-builder/ubuntu-packages.txt` against the fetched checkout (`rust-toolchain.toml`, `script/download-wasi-sdk`, the apt package list in `script/linux`), then run `uv run python -m tools.zed_i18n.linux_builder validate-zed`. Editing anything under `docker/linux-builder/` or `config/linux-builder.toml` republishes the Linux builder image automatically on push to `master`.
- When bumping the Zed version, update the README source of truth at `docs/readme/ko-KR.md` first, then synchronize `README.md` and every other `docs/readme/*.md` localized README in the same version-bump task so badges, release links, and example checkout paths match `config/project.toml`.
- README synchronization is a version-bump completion requirement. Before reporting the bump complete, verify that the root README and every localized README use the configured Zed version and contain no stale version-specific badge, release link, or checkout example.
- After bumping the Zed version and running `fetch-zed`, run the Zed patch contract test before release work:
  `ZED_I18N_REQUIRE_ZED_PATCH_CONTRACT=1 ZED_I18N_PATCH_CONTRACT_ZED_ROOT=.cache/zed/<version> uv run python -m unittest tests.test_zed_patch_contracts`.
- After a version-bump extract, run `uv run zed-i18n generate-version-diff` (or pass `--base-ref <ref>` for a non-default baseline). The command reads the Git baseline and writes the gitignored, regeneratable report at `reports/version-diff/<from-version>-to-<to-version>/key-changes.json`.
- The main orchestrator only runs the generator command. It must not compare keys, classify semantic relationships, rewrite candidates, or distribute candidate records to translation agents.
- During a version bump, investigate key changes for the bump report, not for translation (reference injection stays automatic): sweep the upstream changes between the old and new clean checkouts for user-visible strings that never landed in the catalog (extraction gaps), treat report `candidates` as likely renamed or reshaped keys, and check deleted keys without candidates against the new checkout before concluding they are truly gone.
- Before a version bump ends, review every newly added key individually, using parallel read-only sub-agents when useful. For each key, inspect its actual source location, surrounding code, related strings, and any applicable `context_group`, then set its status in `manifest/ui-strings.json` to `accepted` or `ignored`. Do not decide from generated audit or version-diff reports alone.
- A version bump ends with a user-facing summary of added and deleted keys that flags likely renamed/reshaped pairs; do not translate new keys during the bump itself. New-key translation is a separate follow-up run driven by `prompts/commands/translation-start-new-keys.md`.
- If Zed-side changes require code updates during a version bump, update this project for the current target Zed version instead of preserving compatibility with older Zed versions.

## Translation Workflow

- Language-specific style guides live in `prompts/translation/<language>.md`; fallback is `prompts/translation/TEMPLATE.md`.
- Curated terminology glossaries are in `prompts/translation/glossary/` (`English | Context | Translation` tables; field-verified, not auto-generated).
- `prepare-translation` writes batch prompts to `reports/translation/<language>/` (default) or a custom `--output-dir`.
- `prepare-translation` keeps grouped setting title/description entries, adjacent connected-line entries, and prompt-component entries in the same batch where possible. Batch entries may include a `context_group` object with sibling strings and existing translations for review context; sub-agents still output only the exact source keys assigned in `entries`.
- Use `extract-context-groups --language <language>` when you need review-only reports that pair setting titles with descriptions, show connected multi-line strings, or group composed prompt/message box pieces without running a translation batch.
- During a version bump, `prepare-translation` automatically loads exactly one valid report for the current version and injects locale-specific `previous_version_references` into matching batch entries. Missing, invalid, or ambiguous reports are non-blocking and produce no references.
- Translation and validation agents treat `previous_version_references` only as optional historical hints. They decide whether a hint still applies using the current source, code context, context group, style guide, and glossary; current placeholders and protected tokens win, and results contain only current source keys.
- Each translation sub-agent writes only its assigned `results/batch-###.json`.
- After merging into the final `translations/<language>.json`, always run `validate --language <language>`. Success removes the temporary `reports/translation/<language>` workspace unless `--no-cleanup` is passed.

### Model-scoped translation runs

When comparing models, use `--output-dir` and `--output` to keep runs separate:

```
uv run zed-i18n prepare-translation --language ko-KR --all --output-dir reports/translation-runs/ko-KR/<model-slug>
uv run zed-i18n merge-translation --language ko-KR --results-dir reports/translation-runs/ko-KR/<model-slug>/results --output translations/ko-KR.<model-slug>.json
```

The final `translations/<lang>.json` is produced by reviewing model outputs — see the orchestration prompts below. Use the full-run prompts for complete model comparisons; use the `new-keys` prompts for incremental missing-only accepted strings.

### Orchestration prompts (in `prompts/commands/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `translation-start.md` | End-to-end autonomous translation run for one language and model. Drives `prepare-translation` → parallel sub-agents → `merge-translation`. Fill in `MODEL_ID` and `LOCALE` at the top. |
| `translation-review.md` | Merge two model-scoped translation files into the final `translations/<lang>.json`. Fill in `LOCALE`, `MODEL_A`, `MODEL_B`. |
| `translation-start-new-keys.md` | All-language incremental run for accepted strings missing from existing final translations. Writes new-key-only model artifacts and must not run `merge-translation`. Fill in `MODEL_ID`. |
| `translation-review-new-keys.md` | Compare two new-key-only model artifacts for every final locale, apply selected entries into `translations/<lang>.json`, then validate. Fill in `MODEL_A`, `MODEL_B`, `REVIEW_AGENT_MODEL`. |

## Build Notes

- Zed Windows builds should run outside the sandbox.
- Use `.cache/zed/target` as the shared local Cargo cache via `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.
- Start local Windows release builds with `-j 8`; increase only if CPU and memory headroom are comfortable.

## Generated Files

- `reports/*` is generated output except `reports/README.md`.
- `reports/context-groups/` stores review-only grouped setting, connected-line, and prompt-component reports generated by `extract-context-groups`.
- `reports/translation-runs/` stores per-model translation batch data, preserved across runs.
- `reports/translation-review/` stores generated review workspaces for new-key model comparisons.
- `reports/version-diff/<from-version>-to-<to-version>/key-changes.json` is the gitignored, regeneratable version-diff report that `prepare-translation` automatically consumes when exactly one valid current-version report exists.
- `.cache/non_translated_result` contains user review material and should be preserved unless the user says otherwise.
